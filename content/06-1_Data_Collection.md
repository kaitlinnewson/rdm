# Record the Process of Data Collection

In your research data management plan, it's important to include various aspects related to data collection. First, describe the **type of data** you will collect, such as text, images, audio, or scans. 

When choosing **file formats**, it is recommended to use non-proprietary, open data formats like CSV or txt. These formats promote accessibility and long-term usability. 

You can refer to the <a href="02_file_formats.md" target="_blank">File Formatting workshop</a> for further guidance.

Next, outline the **softwares and/or platforms** that you will utilize for data collection. Provide a brief explanation of the tools or applications that will be involved in the data collection process.

Additionally, it is crucial to discuss how you will organize your data. This includes details regarding **file naming and versioning**. Adopting a naming convention for your files can greatly enhance the organization and discoverability of your data. 

You can consult the <a href="01_file_naming.md" target="_blank">File Naming workshop</a> for valuable recommendations and best practices.

By addressing these considerations in your research data management plan, you can ensure that your data collection process is well-documented, standardized, and facilitates efficient data organization and future utilization.

There are many tools for aiding researchers with version control. These tools vary from simpler automated backup systems to platforms with customizable backup and versioning capabilities. If you use any, e.g. Git and Github; The Open Science Framework (OSF) or others - mention and name them in your plan.


# Indigenous Research Data

There are specific considerations and protocols surrounding Indigenous research data collection, use, and sharing.

## UBC Principles for Indigenous Data Governance

UBC's <a href="https://irsi.ubc.ca" target="_blank">Indigenous Research Support Initiative (ISRI)</a> has published its own Principles for Indigenous Data Governance.

1. UBC recognizes Indigenous self-governance and self-determination.
2. Engagement and data governance will be informed by Indigenous communities following a community-driven and Nation-based pathway.
3. Ownership and right to control their data, as asserted by Indigenous governments
4. Recognition that access and possession of Indigenous data must be respectfully permitted by the relevant authority. This applies to the collection, protection, use, and management of data records and information.
5. UBC helps to advance the interests, rights, and jurisdiction with respect to reclamation of information in UBC's possession including research data, records, and other types of information.
6. Indigenous data governance standards apply to data that relates to each Nation.

## CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance

The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance are designed to complement the FAIR principles and take into account the current and historic power imbalances between researchers and Indigenous communities.

**C**ollective Benefit
{: .label .label-green }

        "Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to 
        derive benefit from the data."

**A**uthority to Control
{: .label .label-green }

        Indigenous people have the right and authority to control their data.

**R**esponsibility
{: .label .label-green }

        Researchers working with Indigenous Peoples have a responsibility to support Indigenous Peoples 
        rights.

**E**thics
{: .label .label-green }

        "Indigenous Peoples' rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of the 
        data life cycle and across the data ecosystem."

The CARE Principles can be examined in depth <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d3799de845604000199cd24/t/5da9f4479ecab221ce848fb2/1571419335217/CARE%2BPrinciples_One%2BPagers%2BFINAL_Oct_17_2019.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

## The First Nations Principles of OCAP速
The OCAP速 Principles of data governance outline how to interact with First Nations data.

**O**wnership
{: .label .label-yellow}

        First Nations communities or groups own their data collectively.

**C**ontrol
{: .label .label-yellow}

        First Nations communities can control all aspects of the research cycle that impact them 
        directly.

**A**ccess
{: .label .label-yellow}

        First Nations retain access to the data, regardless of where it is held.

**P**ossession
{: .label .label-yellow}

        First Nations retain physical control of the data.
