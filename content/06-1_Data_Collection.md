# Record the Process of Data Collection

In your research data management plan, it's important to include various aspects related to data collection. First, describe the **type of data** you will collect, such as text, images, audio, or scans. 

When choosing **file formats**, it is recommended to use non-proprietary, open data formats like CSV or txt. These formats promote accessibility and long-term usability.

You can refer to the <a href="02_file_formats.md" target="_blank">File Formatting workshop</a> for further guidance.

Next, outline the **softwares and/or platforms** that you will utilize for data collection. Provide a brief explanation of the tools or applications that will be involved in the data collection process.

</p>

Additionally, it is crucial to discuss how you will organize your data. This includes details regarding **file naming and versioning**. You should aim for concise but descriptive file names, a consistent naming system, and a simple hierarchy. Adopting a naming convention like that for your files can greatly enhance the organization and discoverability of your data.

You can consult the <a href="01_file_naming.md" target="_blank">File Naming workshop</a> for valuable recommendations and best practices.

There are many tools for aiding researchers with version control. These tools vary from simpler automated backup systems to platforms with customizable backup and versioning capabilities. If you use any, e.g. <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>; <a href="https://osf.openscience.ubc.ca/"> The Open Science Framework (OSF)</a> or others - mention and name them in your plan.
