## Data Type & File Formarts

First, describe the *type of data* you will collect, such as text, images, audio, or scans. 

Each file type has many *file formats* available. When choosing file formats, it is recommended to use non-proprietary, open data formats like CSV or txt. These formats promote accessibility and long-term usability.

## Tools

Next, outline the **softwares and/or platforms** that you will utilize for data collection. Provide a brief explanation of the tools or applications that will be involved in the data collection process.

## Data Organization

Additionally, it is crucial to discuss how you will organize your data. This includes details regarding **file naming and versioning**. 

### File Naming
{: .no_toc}

You should aim for concise but descriptive file names, a consistent naming system, and a simple hierarchy. Adopting a naming convention like that for your files can greatly enhance the organization and discoverability of your data.

### Versioning
{: .no_toc}

There are many tools for aiding researchers with version control. These tools vary from simpler automated backup systems to platforms with customizable backup and versioning capabilities. If you use any, e.g. <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>; <a href="https://osf.openscience.ubc.ca/"> The Open Science Framework (OSF)</a> or others - mention and name them in your plan.
