# Documentation and Metadata

## The FAIR Principles
Metadata, the descriptive data about your project, supports your project's ability to be FAIR.

- **F**indable - Findable data is discoverable thanks to its metadata.
- **A**ccessible - Accessible data is always available and obtainable, this does not mean the files are open, rather that you can access the metadata regarding the files.
- **I**nteroperable - Interoperable data is able to be used by many researchers from many locations
- **R**eusable - Reusable data is described, licensed, and shared in such a way that wide reuse is possible.

All data can be FAIR, but not all FAIR data is open. OpenAIRE states that data should be "*as open as possible, as closed as necessary*." Not all data can be fully open, but it should still be findable at the metadata level.

## Metadata
Metadata is often described as "data about data" and helps answer the questions of who, what, when, where, why. This descriptive data is essential for creating FAIR and open data, and ensuring that the datasets you preserve will be accessible for many years to come.

Metadata makes it easier for researchers to:
- share their data,
- publicize their data,
- locate and retrieve data sets from others.




### Three of the most common categories of metadata
1. **Descriptive**: Descriptive metadata describes the content and context of your data at both the dataset and item level. 
- Examples: title, author, keywords
2. **Administrative**: Administrative metadata includes information needed to use the data.
- Examples: software requirements, copyright, licensing
3. **Structural**: Structural metadata describes how different datasets relate to one another, or any processing or formatting steps that were undertaken.
- Examples: Information about the relationship between data sets in a database, file formats

        Take a moment to think about your research project. What kind of descriptive, administrative and structural metadata might you want to record?

## Create a README File
To ensure that fellow researchers can understand and reuse your data, it is crucial to describe what method you will use to facilitate comprehension. One effective approach is to create a robust **README file**. This file should include comprehensive information about your dataset (i.e. *metadata*), such as its contents, provenance, licensing, and instructions on how to interact with it. 

You can refer to our <a href="03_create_readme.md" target="_blank">Create a README File workshop</a> to learn how to create a solid README file.

## Data Dictionary or Codebook
In addition to the README file, you should also consider **defining all your variables** in a data dictionary or codebook. This serves as a reference document that outlines the definitions and characteristics of each variable in your dataset. By clearly defining and documenting your variables, you enable other researchers to understand the structure and meaning of your data, promoting its effective reuse and interpretation. 

Alternatively, you can utilize your README file to provide this information.

# Indigenous Research Data

There are specific considerations and protocols surrounding Indigenous research data collection, use, and sharing.

## UBC Principles for Indigenous Data Governance

UBC's <a href="https://irsi.ubc.ca" target="_blank">Indigenous Research Support Initiative (ISRI)</a> has published its own Principles for Indigenous Data Governance.

1.    UBC recognizes Indigenous self-governance and self-determination.
2.    Engagement and data governance will be informed by Indigenous communities following a community-driven and Nation-based pathway.
3.    Ownership and right to control their data, as asserted by Indigenous governments
4.    Recognition that access and possession of Indigenous data must be respectfully permitted by the relevant authority. This applies to the collection, protection, use, and management of data records and information.
5.    UBC helps to advance the interests, rights, and jurisdiction with respect to reclamation of information in UBC's possession including research data, records, and other types of information.
6.    Indigenous data governance standards apply to data that relates to each Nation.

## CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance

The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance are designed to complement the FAIR principles and take into account the current and historic power imbalances between researchers and Indigenous communities.

CARE stands for:

- Collective Benefit - "Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data."
- Authority to Control - Indigenous people have the right and authority to control their data.
- Responsibility - Researchers working with Indigenous Peoples have a responsibility to support Indigenous Peoples rights.
- Ethics - "Indigenous Peoples' rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle and across the data ecosystem."
