# Documentation and Metadata

## Metadata
Metadata is often described as "data about data" and helps answer the questions of who, what, when, where, why. This descriptive data is essential for creating FAIR and open data, and ensuring that the datasets you preserve will be accessible for many years to come.

Metadata makes it easier for researchers to:
- share their data,
- publicize their data,
- locate and retrieve data sets from others.

### Three of the most common categories of metadata
1. Descriptive: Descriptive metadata describes the content and context of your data at both the dataset and item level. 
- Examples: title, author, keywords
2. Administrative: Administrative metadata includes information needed to use the data.
- Examples: software requirements, copyright, licensing
3. Structural: Structural metadata describes how different datasets relate to one another, or any processing or formatting steps that were undertaken.
- Examples: Information about the relationship between data sets in a database, file formats

Take a moment to think about your research project. What kind of descriptive, administrative and structural metadata might you want to record?

## Create a README File
To ensure that fellow researchers can understand and reuse your data, it is crucial to describe what method you will use to facilitate comprehension.One effective approach is to create a robust **README file**. This file should include comprehensive information about your dataset (i.e. metadata), such as its contents, provenance, licensing, and instructions on how to interact with it. 

You can refer to our <a href="03_create_readme.md" target="_blank">Create a README File workshop</a> to learn how to create a solid README file.

## Data Dictionary or Codebook
In addition to the README file, you should also consider **defining all your variables** in a data dictionary or codebook. This serves as a reference document that outlines the definitions and characteristics of each variable in your dataset. By clearly defining and documenting your variables, you enable other researchers to understand the structure and meaning of your data, promoting its effective reuse and interpretation. 

Alternatively, you can utilize your README file to provide this information.
