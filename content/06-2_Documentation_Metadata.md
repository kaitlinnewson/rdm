# Documentation and Metadata

To ensure that fellow researchers can understand and reuse your data, it is crucial to provide them with a method that facilitates comprehension. Describe what method you will use.

One effective approach is to create a robust **README file**. This file should include comprehensive information about your dataset, such as its contents, provenance, licensing, and instructions on how to interact with it. 

You can refer to our <a href="03_create_readme.md" target="_blank">Create a README File workshop</a> to learn how to create a solid README file.

In addition to the README file, you should also consider **defining all your variables** in a data dictionary or codebook. This serves as a reference document that outlines the definitions and characteristics of each variable in your dataset. By clearly defining and documenting your variables, you enable other researchers to understand the structure and meaning of your data, promoting its effective reuse and interpretation. *Alternatively, you can utilize your README file to provide this information.*
