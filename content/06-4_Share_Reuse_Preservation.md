# Data Sharing, Reuse & Preservation

What are they? something important they share: format conversion, repositories

then, talk about sharing, reuse, preservation

What forms of the data are you sharing? - Raw, processed, analyzed, and final are all options
- Do the funding agency or publisher mandate any of these for you?

What license do you plan to apply? » We like the CC-0 and CC-BY for research data


» Much easier when you’ve maintained your RDM and implemented your DMP
» Effectively boxing up some of your research data
» All documentation and metadata should be complete at this stage


# Data Preservation

What is your plan for long time access? Research data preservation involves ensuring that research data *remains accessible, usable, and understandable over time*. 

The preservation process encompasses converting data into **sustainable formats**, storing it in **secure repositories**, and providing comprehensive **metadata and documentation**.

When considering what data should be preserved, it's important to note that *not all data you create needs to be preserved*. In some areas of science,  it is often less expensive to resequence the data sample than to store all the data, especially in the preservation layer. Factors such as the value of your data and funding requirements should be taken into consideration. Consult with <research.data@ubc.ca> as needed to make informed decisions about which data, if any, should be digitally preserved.


## Format Conversion
In terms of how to preserve data, it is advisable to consider using **optimal file formats**, preferably non-proprietary ones, that support long-term preservation. 

For guidance on preferred file formats, you can refer to the <a href="02_file_formats.md" target="_blank">File Formatting workshop</a>.

## Data Repositories

A repository is a platform that allows researchers to store, share and manage their data in a secure and accessible way. Using a repository for data management can:

•  assign a persistent, unique identifier to the data, such as a **Digital Object Identifier (DOI)**, which can be used to cite and link the data in publications and other platforms.

•  provide **backup and preservation** services for the data, ensuring that the data is not lost or corrupted over time and that it can be retrieved in case of any disaster.

•  enable **data citation**, which can enhance the visibility, impact and recognition of the data and its creators.

•  allow the data owner to choose a **license** for the data, which specifies the terms and conditions of how the data can be used, reused and distributed by others. A license can protect the rights and interests of the data owner and promote ethical and responsible data sharing.

•  support **version control**, which is the process of tracking and documenting the changes made to the data over time. Version control can facilitate collaboration, reproducibility and transparency of the data.

•  perform **data integrity checks**, which are methods of verifying the quality, accuracy and completeness of the data. This can ensure that the data is reliable and trustworthy for analysis and reuse.
