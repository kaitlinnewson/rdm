# Why is file naming important? 
{: .no_toc }

<p style="margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:25px">
Creating a well-organized hierarchy of files with clear naming conventions is an important part of improving your research process. This is especially important if you are working with large data sets and complex output files or coordinating with multiple people at multiple institutions. There are many ways to structure your folders, and multiple naming conventions you can use. The key is <b>consistency</b>. Make your file names descriptive, and include information about dates and versioning. The best practice is to consult with your lab or with your co-workers to develop a naming schema that everyone is willing to follow consistently.

Goal
{: .label .label-green }

    - The characters in file names should be able to handled by all computer systems.
    - The names should be brief and easily searchable. 

<p style="margin-top:25px;margin-bottom:20px">
<h3> Only use the following: </h3>
</p>

- Alphanumeric characters (alphabetic characters and Arabic numerials)  

<p style="margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:20px">
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="figures/alphanumeric.png" width="200"/> </p>

- Element delimiters: **_(underscore)**  
- Word delimiters (within an element): **-(dash)** and/or **capitalize** the first letter of each word (camel case)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;e.g. [element 1]\_[element 2]\_[WordPart-WordPart-WordPart]_[element 3].txt

Avoid spaces and special characters, such as: ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ` ; : < > ? . , [ ] { } ' "  \|   <img src="figures/say-no.png" width="19">
{: .warn}


<h3> Make sure to do the following: </h3>

- If you decide to abbreviate the elements with 2- or 3-letter codes (e.g. project 1 = P1, mouse = "MUS"), make sure these are well documented.
- Keep case sensitivity in mind - Machine searching for files named "Scan" would not find files named "scan".  
  

  
  
### Exercise 1


Let's try improve the file names! Pick your favourite file name and make it more machine-readable!

<p style="margin-top:20px">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="figures/human-reading.jpg" width="300"/>
</p>

Goal
{: .label .label-green }

    - The file names should provide concise information.  
    - They are easily understandable to anyone who may access them in future.
    
  

- Provide **essential information** concisely in the file name
   - Ideally 3 elements, 5 max.
   - Avoid complex hierarchical folder structures.
- Consider putting authors' names in the file name.
   - Put family names first followed by first names or initials.
- Write down your naming convention pattern and **document it** in your README file.
   - e.g. My file naming convention is [SA-MPL-EID]\_[YYYY-MM-DD]\_[###]_[status].[txt]
   - Define acronyms, abbreviations and codes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="figures/follow-rule.jpg" width="300"/>
</p>

Goal
{: .label .label-green }

    - The names should start with the element that is used to order the files.
    - Keep versions at the end.

- Decide the beginning of the file name according to how you want to sort and search for your files.
- When using a sequential numbering system, use **leading zeros** to make sure files sort in sequential order. e.g. 001, 002, 010, 011....100,101 ...
- Order elements from general to specific to make searching easier
- Use ISO 8601 standard for dates: **YYYYMMDD** or **YYYY-MM-DD** 
- Versions: should be used as the last element
   - For **version numbers**, use at least two digits with a leading zero (e.g. v0)
   - Version types (e.g. _raw, _processed, _composite)

### Exercise 2


<img src="figures/thermometer.jpg" width="150"/>

Your lab has a spectrometer that is measuring thermal emissions once a day for a year for your experiment. 
There are three people who take that measurement in the lab. 

Please create a file naming convention for these files to reflect what you have learned about file naming in today's session.

Now you know how to organize files with your own file naming conventions! As long as your names are clear and consistent, you are good to move forward!
