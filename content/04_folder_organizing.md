# Why is folder organizing important?
Let‚Äôs pretend that you store everything on your computer in one single folder‚Äìsome of us are probably known to use our desktops for this. Imagine how long it would take you to find data you collected on a specific day a few years ago. 

Instead of keeping every document in a single place, we often organize our files using directory or folder structures. This helps us save precious time and improve our productivity. Organizing folders can also help us collaborate more effectively by ensuring that everyone can find the files they need.
