# Why Create DMPs?

**A Data Management Plan (DMP)** is a short, formal document which clearly articulates the strategies and tools you will implement to effectively manage your data. The objective of a DMP is to address issues related to data management at the very beginning, when you are starting your research project. It speaks to the management of data both <b>during</b> the active phases of your research and <b>after</b> the completion of the research project.

<a href="https://science.gc.ca/site/science/en/interagency-research-funding/policies-and-guidelines/research-data-management/tri-agency-research-data-management-policy">The Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy</a> states that: "All grant proposals submitted to the agencies should include methodologies that reflect best practices in RDM (Research Data Management). For certain funding opportunities (listed below), the agencies will *require data management plans (DMPs)* to be submitted to the appropriate agency at the time of application, as outlined in the call for proposals; in these cases, the DMPs will be considered in the adjudication process."

## Funding requiring DMPs

</p>


So far, we are seeing the following funding opportunities requiring DMPs, in addition to all CFI (Canada Foundation for Innovation) applications:

### <a style="font-size:17px">CIHR</a>
{: .label .label-yellow .no_toc }

- Network Grants in Skin Health and Muscular Dystrophy 
- Data Science for Equity 
- Virtual Care/Digital Health Team Grants, now renamed to Team Grant: Strengthening the Health Workforce for System Transformation


### <a style="font-size:17px">NSERC</a>
{: .label .label-yellow .no_toc }

- Subatomic Physics Discovery Grants program (Individual and Project).

### <a style="font-size:17px">SHHRC</a>
{: .label .label-yellow .no_toc }

- Partnership Grants Phase 2.

# General Notes for DMP creation

- When creating your research project's DMP, it's important to begin with a general description that outlines the project's focus and purpose. 
- Keep in mind that the DMP should be easily understood by anyone, so try to avoid using excessive discipline-specific jargon. 
- If you do need to use acronyms, be sure to define them for clarity.
- Not all sections or questions in the DMP may be applicable to your specific project, so feel free to leave them blank if necessary. 
- Additionally, consider including <a href="https://researchdata.library.ubc.ca/plan/get-an-orcid-id" target="_blank"> **ORCIDs**</a> (Open Researcher and Contributor IDs) for the researchers involved. ORCIDs provide metadata that ensure appropriate academic credits are attributed.

Remember that your DMP is a living document that should be **developed at the very beginning** in the research process and **regularly updated** as needed, similar to your README file and data dictionary.

# Tools to Create DMPs

## DMP Assistant in Canada
{: .no_toc}

To create your DMP, please use <span class="fs-3" align="center"> <a href="https://assistant.portagenetwork.ca" target="_blank"><u>DMP Assistant</u></a>{: .btn .btn-purple }</span>. 

This is a free, open-source Canadian tool created by the Canadian Libraries' Portage community for preparing DMPs. It is available in *both English and French* and allows you to create and export your DMP. 

UBC has a *general template for UBC researchers*. This tool follows best practices in data stewardship and walks researchers step-by-step through key questions about data management. 

<p style="margin-top:25px;margin-left:30px;margin-bottom:25px">
<img src="figures/dmp_assistant.jpeg" width="700"/>
</p>


DMP Assistant is designed to meet the requirements of these Canadian funders:
- Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI)
- Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)
- Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)
- Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)


The Portage community has also collaborated on some excellent <a href="https://zenodo.org/communities/portage-network/search?page=1&size=20&q=exemplar" target="_blank">**exemplars**</a>. These exemplars cover a range of disciplines and research methods, highlight best practices for DMPs in those disciplines, and provide a reference point for researchers writing their own DMPs.

## Other tools
{: .no_toc}

In the United States, the University of California maintains <a href="https://dmptool.org/" target="_blank">DMP Tool</a>, and the Digital Curation Centre in the UK maintains <a href="https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/" target="_blank">DMP Online</a>. Each of these tools functions similarly by walking you through the process of writing a DMP.
