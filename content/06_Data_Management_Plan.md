# Why Create DMP?

**A Data Management Plan (DMP)** is a short, formal document which clearly articulates the strategies and tools you will implement to effectively manage your data. It speaks to the management of data both <b>during</b> the active phases of your research and <b>after</b> the completion of the research project. 

<a href="https://science.gc.ca/site/science/en/interagency-research-funding/policies-and-guidelines/research-data-management/tri-agency-research-data-management-policy">The Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy</a> states that: "All grant proposals submitted to the agencies should include methodologies that reflect best practices in RDM. For certain funding opportunities, the agencies will require data management plans (DMPs) to be submitted to the appropriate agency at the time of application, as outlined in the call for proposals; in these cases, the DMPs will be considered in the adjudication process."

So far, we are seeing the following funding opportunities requiring DMPs, in addition to all CFI applications:

### CIHR

- Network Grants in Skin Health and Muscular Dystrophy (launch fall 2022 / winter 2023)
- Data Science for Equity (launch fall 2022 / winter 2023)
- Virtual Care/Digital Health Team Grants (launch fall 2022 / winter 2023)
- Team Grant: Strengthening the Health Workforce for System Transformation (Summer 2023)

### NSERC

- Subatomic Physics Discovery Grants program (Individual and Project) for fall 2023.

### SHHRC

- Partnership Grants Phase 2 (2023)


To create your DMP, please use <a href="https://assistant.portagenetwork.ca/tool" target="_blank"> DMP Assistant</a>, a free, open-source Canadian tool for preparing data management plans (DMPs). The tool follows best practices in data stewardship and walks researchers step-by-step through key questions about data management. DMP Assistant is designed to meet the requirements of these Canadian funders:

- Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI)
- Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)
- Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)
- Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC)

DMP Assistant is available in both English and French. It allows you to create and export your DMP. Portage has created some excellent <a href="https://zenodo.org/communities/portage-network/search?page=1&size=20&q=exemplar">exemplars </a>for numerous disciplines and UBC has a general template for use by UBC researchers.
