# What is UBC Dataverse Collection?

{: .no_toc }

UBC Dataverse Collection is a cross-disciplinary research data repository on Borealis. 

Borealis, the Canadian Dataverse Repository, is a bilingual, multidisciplinary, secure, Canadian research data repository, supported by academic libraries and research institutions across Canada. Borealis supports open discovery, management, sharing, and preservation of Canadian research data stored entirely on Canadian servers. Datasets in the dataverse collection are discoverable by Google, UBC Library Summon, FRDR, DataCite, and much more.


It is an open-source application to publish, share, reference, cite, extract and analyze research data. UBC Library can create a Dataverse setup for your research group where you can actively manage your data, share it securely with colleagues, provide version control, establish a permanent data citation, get a DOI for your dataset, and more. All Dataverse files are digitally preserved.
