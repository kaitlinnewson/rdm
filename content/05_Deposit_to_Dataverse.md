# Why deposit data?

Storing your data in a repository like Borealis makes it easy for other researchers, publishers, and collaborators to find, use, and cite your data. It supports the Open Science movement goals of trans-parency, accessibility, and collaboration, and can increase attention to your work.

Further, the Tri-Agency in Canada (NSERC, CIHR, SSHRC) have introduced <a href="https://bit.lv/2H3mGLv" target="_blank">a policy</a> requiring some grant recipients to deposit their project data in a repository.
