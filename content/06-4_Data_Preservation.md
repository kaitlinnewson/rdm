# What is your plan for long time access?
Research data preservation involves ensuring that research data remains accessible, usable, and understandable over time. It encompasses converting data into sustainable formats, storing it in secure repositories, and providing comprehensive metadata and documentation.


# What data should be preserved?

When considering what data should be preserved, it's important to note that not all data you create needs to be preserved. Factors such as the *value of your data and funding requirements* should be taken into consideration. Consult with <research.data@ubc.ca> as needed to make informed decisions about which data, if any, should be digitally preserved.


# How to preserve data?

In terms of how to preserve data, it is advisable to consider using **optimal file formats**, preferably non-proprietary ones, that support long-term preservation. 

For guidance on preferred file formats, you can refer to the <a href="02_file_formats.md" target="_blank">File Formatting workshop</a>.
