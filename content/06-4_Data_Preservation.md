# Data Preservation
{: .no_toc}

What is your plan for long time access? Research data preservation involves ensuring that research data *remains accessible, usable, and understandable over time*. 

The preservation process encompasses converting data into **sustainable formats**, storing it in **secure repositories**, and providing comprehensive **metadata and documentation**.

When considering what data should be preserved, it's important to note that *not all data you create needs to be preserved*. Factors such as the value of your data and funding requirements should be taken into consideration. Consult with <research.data@ubc.ca> as needed to make informed decisions about which data, if any, should be digitally preserved.


## How to preserve data?

### Format Conversion
In terms of how to preserve data, it is advisable to consider using **optimal file formats**, preferably non-proprietary ones, that support long-term preservation. 

For guidance on preferred file formats, you can refer to the <a href="02_file_formats.md" target="_blank">File Formatting workshop</a>.
