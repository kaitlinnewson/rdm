# Ethics and Legal Compliance

Managing and sharing research data involves various **legal, ethical, and intellectual property issues** that need to be addressed and respected. These issues may include:
- the protection of personal information,
- the confidentiality of sensitive data, 
- the consent of data subjects, 
- the ownership of data, 
- the attribution of data sources, 
- the compliance with relevant laws and regulations, and more.

Researchers who manage and share their data should be aware of these issues and explain how they will <u>follow the appropriate guidelines and policies</u> for their field and region. 

They should also ensure that they comply with any applicable <u>privacy legislation and laws</u>, including those imposed by their funders or institutions. These may require researchers to obtain ethical approval, inform data subjects, anonymize or encrypt data, secure data storage and transfer, respect data licenses and agreements, and report any breaches or incidents.


## FIPPA
The <a href="https://universitycounsel.ubc.ca/subject-areas/access-and-privacy-general/access-to-information/about-fippa/" target="_blank"> FIPPA</a>, British Columbia Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, is provincial legislation that
- make public bodies more open and accountable by providing the public with a right of access to records; 
- protect personal information from unauthorized collection, use, or disclosure by public bodies.

## TCPS 2 (2018)

The <a href="https://ethics.gc.ca/eng/policy-politique_tcps2-eptc2_2018.html" target="_blank">Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans â€“ TCPS 2 (2018)</a> is a policy document that provides <u>ethical guidelines and principles for conducting research</u> involving human participants in Canada. 

It was developed by the three federal research funding agencies: the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC). The policy applies to all research involving human participants that is funded by these agencies or conducted under the auspices of institutions that receive agency funding.
