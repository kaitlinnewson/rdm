# Introduction to Research Data Management

Research data management (RDM) are processes applied throughout the lifecycle of a research project to guide the collection, documentation, storage, sharing, and preservation of research data. It is important because it helps organize your research data during and after your research cycle and makes responsibilities clear within research team and during team transitions. Some Tri-Agency (CIHR, NSERC, SSHRC) grants require Research Data Management Plans (DMPs) in their applications.

By going through our mini-workshops "<b>Data Bites</b>", you will learn the basics of RDM in 30 mintues from the following 4 core components:
- File naming
- File formats for data curation
- Folder organizing
- Creating a README file
