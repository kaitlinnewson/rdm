# Introduction to Research Data Management

Research data management (RDM) are processes applied throughout the lifecycle of a research project to guide the collection, documentation, storage, sharing, and preservation of research data. It is important because it helps organize your research data during and after your research cycle and makes responsibilities clear within research team and during team transitions. Some Tri-Agency (CIHR, NSERC, SSHRC) grants require Research Data Management Plans (DMPs) in their applications.

Research Commons is now offering bite-size workshops "<b>Data Bites</b>" that are 30 minutes each during lunch time. By going through our mini-workshops, you will learn the basics of RDM from the following 4 core components:
- File naming
- File formats for data curation
- Folder organizing
- Creating a README file
